<h2>Welcome to LAVA</h2>

<p>LAVA is an automated validation architecture primarily aimed at testing deployments of systems based around the
Linux kernel on ARM devices, specifically ARMv7 and later. The current range of boards (<a
href="{{ STATIC_URL }}docs/glossary.html#term-device-type">device types</a>) supported by this LAVA instance can be seen
on the <a href="{% url 'lava.scheduler' %}">scheduler status</a> page which includes details of how many boards
of each type are available for tests and currently running jobs.</p>

<h3>Testing in LAVA</h3>
<h4><a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}docs/writing-tests.html">Writing a LAVA test definition</a></h4>

<p>Each test can provide a result, including a <a
href="{{ STATIC_URL }}docs/writing-tests.html#recording-test-case-measurements-and-units">measurement and units</a> or a as
<a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}docs/writing-tests.html#recording-test-case-results">a pass/fail/skip</a>, with
<a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}docs/glossary.html#term-bundle-stream">results being bundled into set</a> from each test job.
Tests can be as simple as using <code>ping</code> with a known address to ensure that the kernel has raised the
network interface correctly, to a single result obtained by downloading, compiling and executing third party test
suites.</p>

<p>Tests can be run on a single device or combined across multiple devices and some devices can use dedicated test
hardware like <a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}docs/lmp_test_guide.html">lmp</a> with jobs selecting those devices using tags.
LAVA does not dictate which tests can be run, so to get an idea of what tests other people have been running in LAVA,
take a look at the <a href="{% url 'lava.dashboard' %}">Dashboard</a>. Bundles contain details of the environment in which the test
was run as well as the test results from completed jobs. Bundles are collected into <a
href="{{ STATIC_URL }}docs/glossary.html#term-bundle-stream">bundle streams</a>, some of which are publicly visible. Each
bundle stream provides access to bundles of test results and each bundle can be inspected exported
or downloaded for further analysis. Exports are available as CSV or JSON. A variety of queries are supported
over <a href="/api/help">XMLRPC</a>.</p>

<p><a href="{% url 'lava.dashboard.filters_list' %}">Dashboard filters</a> allow results in bundles
to be <a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}docs/filters-reports.html">compared by matching criteria about the device under test</a>, the
type of test being run or most other elements of a test job. Filters then provide the basis for <a
href="{{ STATIC_URL }}docs/lava-dashboard-image-reports.html">image reports</a> which can provide detailed graphs of results
over time, with links back to individual tests, output from the LAVA log file and the original
<a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}docs/glossary.html#term-job-definition">test job definition</a>.</p>
