LAVA Components
###############

=============== =========================================
lava            meta-package for single instance setup
lava-server     apache and WSGI settings and HTML content
lava-dispatcher dispatches jobs to devices
=============== =========================================

.. _packaging_daemon_renaming:

Daemon renaming
===============

The main scheduler daemon is now explicitly named and only restarts
the scheduler daemon::

 $ sudo service lava-server restart

The web application itself is handled within apache, so to refresh
the code running behind the front end, use::

 $ sudo apache2ctl restart

The ``LAVA_SYS_USER`` has also been renamed from an instance-specific
name to ``lavaserver``. ``lava-server manage`` can also be run as a
normal user or by root. The system user is used just for the filesystem
permissions.

WSGI debugging help
===================

https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/DebuggingTechniques

If you get a 502 bad gateway, the uwsgi is probably not setup.
