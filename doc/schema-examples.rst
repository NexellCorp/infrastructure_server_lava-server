Example Bundles
***************

This document contains a few example bundles. More
bundles are included in the source distribution.

Smallest bundle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Actually all that is needed is the format. The rest
is entirely optional so this bundle is just fine.

.. literalinclude:: linaro_dashboard_bundle/smallest_bundle.json
    :language: javascript
    :linenos:

Everything (1.7)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This bundle has everything possible at once. It is
also using the most recent format (currently 1.7) which
included changes on how the submission JSON was used over
1.6 but no changes in the atual bundle contents.
