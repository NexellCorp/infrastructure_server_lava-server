Job submission failure help

Device type X is not available
******************************

In the absence of other errors, this typically means that the submitted
JSON specifies a :term:`device type` which is not defined in the database
for the instance or is defined but only contains devices which have
been :term:`retired`.

No devices of type X are currently available to user Y
======================================================

A type of device unavailable error where the only available devices of
the specified :term:`device type` are restricted and the logged in user
is not allowed access to the restricted device. Contact the term:`device owner`
if there are queries.

X is not allowed to submit to the restricted device Y
=====================================================

The submitted JSON requested a specific target device instead of a
:term:`device type` and this specific device is restricted by the
:term:`device owner`. Check the status page in LAVA to see if there
are more devices of the required type available or change the JSON to
ask for a device type instead of a specific target.
