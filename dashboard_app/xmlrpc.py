        Return dashboard server version. The version is a string with
        dots separating five components.

        The components are:
            1. major version
            2. minor version
            3. micro version

        scheme, based on git tags named after release dates instead of
        arbitrary major and minor versions, once the migration to packaging
         is complete.

        If called without passing ``since`` (or with ``since`` set to
        ``None``), this method returns up to 100 matches from the filter.  In
        fact, the matches are always capped at 100 -- so set your cronjob to
        execute frequently enough that there are less than 100 matches
        generated between calls!
